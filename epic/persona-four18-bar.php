			<h2>Persona</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Venue Name:</strong> Four18 Bar
					</li>
					<li><strong>Owners Name:</strong> Steven Morrissey
					</li>
					<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Morrissey is a local bar owner in Albuquerque, NM
					</li>
					<li><strong>Technology:</strong> He uses an iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10.2 and a Mac Pro Sierra iOS 10.12
					</li>
					<li><strong>Attitudes/Behaviors:</strong> Morrissey is very dedicated to making his bar the most entertaining venue in Albuquerque. He is always on Facebook looking for bands and musicians to contract to play at his bar Four18 Bar, however he is frustrated that he invests so much time to end up with little result.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Needs:</strong> He wants a networking site thatâ€™s center focused around finding what bands/ musicians are looking for gigs to play. and he would like to be able to hear a sample of the group's music before committing to a contract to find out if they are the right sound for his Bar. the other problem he has is that he wants to have a profile created for his bar. Morrissey feels like he wasts a lot of time looking through junk in his email inbox and often worried that he may pass an email from a band who is looking to get booked. So he wants his profile to be used strictly for his business and creating new contacts.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Goal:</strong>Morrissey is very competitive and very dedicated to attracting more business to his venue. So he is always in search of the best local music trends in his city.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>Morrissey has a spot open for friday nights at his venue, he's not to sure what sound he is  looking for so he decided to get on GigHub. He goes to his venues profile page and sees that he has mail in his inbox. He goes into his inbox and see an email from a band FigStick who is looking for a gig.
			</p>

			<p>Morrissey has never heard of the band's music before so he clicks on the band links and it takes him to the band's profile page.
			</p>

			<p>He scrolls in the profile page to find some information about the band. The band has a sample music box on their page. Morrissey taps play and listens to the band's music.
			</p>
			<p>He likes their sound so he taps back to the email page and decide to send an email to the band to set an appointment.
			</p>
