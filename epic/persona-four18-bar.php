			<h2>Persona</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Venue Name:</strong> Four18 Bar
					</li>
					<li><strong>Owners Name:</strong> Steven Morrissey
					</li>
					<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Morrissey is a local bar owner in Albuquerque, NM
					</li>
					<li><strong>Technology:</strong> He uses an iPhone 7 Plus iOS 10.2 and a Mac Pro Sierra iOS 10.12
					</li>
					<li><strong>Attitudes/Behaviors:</strong> Morrissey is very dedicated to making his bar the most entertaining venue in Albuquerque. He is always on Facebook looking for bands and musicians to contract to play at his bar Four18 Bar, however he is frustrated that he invests so much time to end up with little result.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Needs:</strong> He wants a networking site thatâ€™s center focused around finding what bands/ musicians are looking for gigs to play. and he would like to be able to hear a sample of the group's music before committing to a contract to find out if they are the right sound for his Bar. the other problem he has is that he wants to have a profile created for his bar. Morrissey feels like he wasts a lot of time looking through junk in his email inbox and often worried that he may pass an email from a band who is looking to get booked. So he wants his profile to be used strictly for his business and creating new contacts.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Goal:</strong>Morrissey is very competitive and very dedicated to attracting more business to his venue. So he is always in search of the best local music trends in his city.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>Morrissey has a spot opened up for his friday nights. So he wants to do a live band for fridays. He goes into his email and discovers that he has a notification from GigHub. He opens the email and he sees its from a band FigStick. FigStick is looking for a gig. But Morrissey has never heard of them.
			</p>

			<p>He clicks on the link to the bands GigHub account and he explores the the bands profile. He spots that there is a link to the band's soundcloud and decide to tap into and listens to some tracks. He likes what he hears so he backtracks to the profile page to find a contacts list. When he finds the email, he decides to write them.
