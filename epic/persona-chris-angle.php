			<h1>Persona: Chris Angle</h1>
		</header>
		<main>
			<p><strong>Name:</strong> Chris Angle</p>
			<p><strong>Age:</strong> 32</p>
			<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Event Organizer (i.e. bar crawls)</p>
			<p><strong>Technology:</strong> iPhone 6s+ running iOS 10 and MacBook Air running OS 10</p>
			<p><strong>Attitudes & Behaviors:</strong> Chris is busy. Turning a profit throwing shows and events is hard
				work and takes a lot of organization and communication between venues and acts. Since that is the case his
				phone is constantly ringing, texts come in almost non-stop, and you don’t even want to look at his email
				inbox. Chris is on the go all day orchestrating these events and nights the events take place he is busy
				managing them to ensure everything goes smoothly.</p>
			<p><strong>Frustrations & Needs:</strong> Chris needs to save time. He needs a platform to contact both acts
				and venues easily, and because of his busy lifestyle an app and website like this would be perfect. Now he
				can communicate seamlessly with performers and hosts without having to switch between different mediums
				(Facebook, email, text, etc)</p>
			<p><strong>Goals:</strong>Then end goal by using GigHub he would be able to do all of the “behind-the-scenes”
				work that goes into an event in one place. Making life easier by keeping contacts and information organized.</p>
			<p><strong>Use Case:</strong> Chris is organizing a pub crawl and all that entails. He needs to find bars
				(venues) and bands and/or DJ’s (acts) to perform. Chris heard about GigHub from a buddy and decides to give
				it a whirl. Logging in Chris is pleased, there he can find open dates at venues, and a list of bands and
				DJs in the area and ways to contact them. This will make life so much easier for Chris.</p>
